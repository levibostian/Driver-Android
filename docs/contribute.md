Do you think Teller is cool? Want to help make it *more cool*? Great! We can use your help.

Open source isn't just writing code. Teller could use your help with any of the
following:

- Finding (and reporting!) bugs.
- New feature suggestions.
- Answering questions on issues.
- Documentation improvements.
- Reviewing pull requests.
- Helping to manage issue priorities.
- Fixing bugs/new features.

The Teller community is a very positive one, and the maintainers are committed to keeping things awesome. Like [in over 230,000+ other communities](https://github.com/search?l=Markdown&q=%22Contributor+Covenant%22+fork%3Afalse&type=Code), always assume positive intent; even if a comment sounds mean-spirited, give the person the benefit of the doubt.
