# Release plan to get Teller to Stable

!> Teller is alpha software. Even though it is used in production today with a full test suite, it needs to be used by more people in more apps to be considered more stable. 

Here is the current plan to release Teller in alpha, beta, then stable.

Alpha:

- [X] Example app built demonstrating Teller.
- [ ] JavaDoc completed. (It's being worked on, but it's not fully documented yet)
- [X] Tests written (and passing ðŸ˜‰).
- [X] Full documentation on how to use Teller.

Beta:

- [ ] Teller has been used by more developers, in more apps to prove the API covers the use cases needed.

Stable:

- [ ] Make non-RxJava version of the library to make it even smaller and more portable.
- [ ] Teller has been used by many developers proving the API satisfies the use cases needed and code base is stable.
